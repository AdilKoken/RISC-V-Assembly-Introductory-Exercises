# Bubble sort

## Objective
Implement the bubble sort algorithm. It should sort an array of n bytes. You may assume
that the values are signed and that the array contains at least one entry.
The sorting should be done in-place, i.e. you should not create a new array.
A description of the algorithm can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort).

## Details

### Input
- `a0`: Pointer to starting adress of the array to sort (each entry is 1 byte)
- `a1`: Length of array

### Output

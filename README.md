# RISC-V-Assembly-Introductory-Exercises
collection of exercises designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computer architecture using the RISC-V instruction set.

This repository is an unofficial supplement for students at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Architecture course. However, it's also a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning RISC-V assembly language.

## Environment

This collection of exercises is designed to be used with the **[QtRvSim](https://github.com/cvut/qtrvsim)** environment, a user-friendly simulator tailored for RISC-V assembly language. QtRvSim provides an interactive and visual approach to learning assembly code, making it an ideal platform for beginners.

## Objective

The primary aim of this repository is to provide hands-on, practical exercises to enhance understanding of RISC-V assembly programming. These exercises are tailored to assist beginners in grasping the basic principles of assembly language in a structured and progressive manner.

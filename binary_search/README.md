# Binary Search

## Objective
Develop an assembly function that performs a binary search on a sorted array of 4 byte signed values.
A description of the algorithm can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).
Implement the recursive version of the algorithm!

## Details

### Input
- `a0`: Value to find
- `a1`: Start address of search interval
- `a2`: End address of search interval

### Output
- `a0`: Address of the found element in the original array, or -1 if not found
